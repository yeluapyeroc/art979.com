    <p>November 7, 2008 a 2400 square foot corner building in downtown Bryan opened its newly remodeled doors to invite local artists and art lovers in.   The mission of the gallery is to create awareness of the local art of the Brazos Valley and to give all forms of art a stage to be enjoyed together.   New shows are typically debuted monthly, when downtown businesses host “First Friday.”  Each art opening is accompanied with a live music act and cuisine from the Village Cafe.  First Friday is a great opportunity to come enjoy art, live music, and great food. Current shows can also be viewed Monday through Friday from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. and on weekends from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.</p>

    <p>The gallery space is available for private special events after 6pm each night.  The personality of the space is classic contemporary meets historic downtown.  Our cafe tables combined with our soft seating create the perfect environment for socializing.  The permanent mural and rotating art exhibits provide a great base for conversations and a warm environment.  The ever-changing art brings new life to the space monthly.  Chef Martin Howard sees each new event as an opportunity to showcase his culinary artist ability by personalizing a menu for each individual.

    <p>The cafe is housed inside the Art979 Gallery and is open 7 days a week. The focus of the cafe is to provide you with what we see as the highest quality in dining available. Between 80 and 90% of our ingredients are either “organic” or “natural". We are currently working with more than 15 local growers and businesses and are working towards using completely local products. As we become more in tune with the growing seasons of the area, our menu will begin to rotate based on local availability. This means the food you experience here is extremely fresh, healthy, tasty, and often picked the same day you eat it. We refrain from using refined products, bleached flour, hydrogenated oils, or microwaves. Everything is house-made and prepared in ways that maintain flavor and nutrients. The cafe is trying to minimize our footprint on the earth by recycling, reducing, conserving, and working to make a positive impact in the community. With your help and patronage we will continue to grow the local economy and food systems.</p>

    <p>The rear wall of the gallery is graced by the work of J Vincent Scarpace. A wonderfully colorful and flowing mural representing the many different faces of art hangs above a soft seating area. J. Vincent Scarpace is best-known for his abstract fish art which, to him offers “a personal journey through the use of basic of art elements: line, shape, and color…” Vincent was encouraged from a young age to pursue art, and over the years, his works have evolved from his fundamental knowledge of the basic art elements. Vincent taught arts and mathematics for 13 years after acquiring a degree in education, but now spends his days in his studio, pursuing his artistic journey. His works can be seen in collections worldwide, including in Bryan/College Station at venues like art979.
