The right side is the result of Rami constantly experimenting with different ingredients - what you see are the recipes that actually worked.  The marinara sauce is a secret recipe from his father\u2019s family.  So secret in fact, that until November of 1995, his father would come twice a week just to make 30 gallons of sauce (but not before chasing everyone out of the kitchen).  Thankfully however, business picked up and twice a week was no longer enough so Rami finally learned the recipe.  The open kitchen is there so you can see the food being prepared - we have nothing to hide.\r\n\r\n      We strive to be green and environmentally friendly.  For example, we have switched from foam carryout containers to those that are recyclable & biodegradable.  We recycle all of our cardboard and glass daily.  We use recycled paper for our printing needs.  We are striving to become a zero-waste business.\r\n\r\n      This building was originally a grocery store.

When he goes on to say that he creates these delicacies in a state-of-the-art caf\u00c3\u00a9 and chocolate factory that he designed himself - a former 19th century dry goods store - in Calvert, Texas, you know that something truly extraordinary is happening.\r\nCalvert, a sleepy hamlet in western Robertson County that boasts a perfectly preserved historic downtown, once home to an opera house and the largest cotton gin in the world, is back on the map with world-class ganaches, confections and truffles, crafted by Ken Wilkinson - the creative genius behind COCOAMODA.\r\nWilkinson embodies a philosophy of pursuing excellence at all costs and refusing mediocrity in any shape or form. He oversees every aspect of the creation of COCOAMODA. A classically trained chef hailing from a family of carpenters, Wilkinson designed this ultra-modern operation - from the intricate woodwork to the retrofitted machinery salvaged from an old Pittsburgh chocolate factory. The historic building and kitchen reflect the COCOAMODA chocolates that are crafted thanks to the best of time-tested, traditional techniques in the service of modern, creative innovation.\r\nCOCOAMODA's chocolate creations will be made with the world's best couverture, or chocolate base, made by the French company Valrhona, where he recently met with 10 of the world's most renowned chocolatiers. Cost is no concern when it comes to sourcing the finest ingredients available: almonds from Spain, saffron and pistachios from Iran, hazelnuts from Oregon, Swiss frais de bois, and milk and cream from grass-fed Guernsey cows.\r\nA trip to Calvert isn't just about tasting chocolate. Visitors to COCOAMODA can experience the chocolate-making process when they step into the chocolatier's factory. Just pass through a 19th century brick edifice into a reception room where windows offer a peak into melting vats of chocolate, cooling trays and conveyor belts where the delectable morsels are concocted and tastefully packaged - an area where the heat and humidity must be rigidly controlled to ensure the best quality. The finished product awaits you just across the street at COCOAMODA's restaurant and boutique - a Parisian style caf\u00c3\u00a9 housed in a restored 1870's bank building.\r\nWhile he spent the last five years meticulously planning every detail of COCOAMODA, Wilkinson has been preparing his entire career. His early success would make the plot of a great movie. Still a teenager, back in his native England after training in Switzerland, he apprenticed at a hotel restaurant one busy Friday night when the mercurial chef threw desserts against the wall and walked out, followed shortly after by the sous chef and the saucier. Showing his gift for alchemy that would later mark his chocolate creations, our boy Wilkinson saw the wonderful opportunity in a terrible situation. He stepped into the breech, holding the kitchen down through the weekend and for the next three weeks while the replacements were sought, and actually improved the food and service.\r\nThe legend spread through the local restaurant scene, and chefs began dropping by to check out this preternaturally talented teen, one of whom secured Wilkinson an apprenticeship in the Michelin-starred kitchen at the legendary Bahnhof Buffet in Lucerne, Switzerland. Working on ancient appliances under chefs trained in the style and discipline of the inventor of French cuisine, Escoffier, Wilkinson \"took every kick and beating with a smile.\"\r\nThat Wilkinson, already a success in London, would submit himself to such harsh training techniques speaks to his relentless pursuit of excellence right to the very source. His talent led him to the most refined culinary art, chocolate making, and back in England he studied with the famous chocolatier Eric Berger, whose intricate techniques, kept under lock and key, would be lost to the world save for Wilkinson and Berger's own sons.\r\nMeanwhile members of the royal family kept him busy catering lavish events, which he decorated with his filigreed chocolate sculptures. In the 1980's Wilkinson moved to Houston where he hosted Cable Cookery, a television show dedicated to making classical French cuisine accessible to everyday cooks. He married and started a family, and so it is in Texas that he fulfills his dream of creating the best chocolate experience in the world.\r\nIn recognition of how one man's vision is transforming the face of the historic downtown, the local Chamber of Commerce suggested calling Calvert the \"Chocolate Capital of Texas and Birthplace of COCOAMODA.\" If the experience in Calvert is any indication, other major American cities will be clamoring for their own COCOAMODA boutiques. Not bad for a man with a dream who stumbled upon a little old ghost town with beautiful buildings.\r\nWilkinson offers his own motto, as colorful as his exciting chocolate concoctions: \"Paris in Calvert\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 why not?\"", "name": "CocoaModa", "url": "http://www.cocoamoda.com/", "image": "img/img/default.jpg", "location": "518 S.
