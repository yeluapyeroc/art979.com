Now fast forward more than five hundred years and picture an art studio in Milwaukee where Standing Man emerges from plaster, polyester resin, and paint. Though the setting and subject might be less romantic, Marc Sijan, inspired by Michelangelo\u2019s David, produces superrealistic sculptures that are \u201chomages to humanity\u2019s fascination with its own forms.\u201d\r\n\r\n<p>Both artists certainly display a talent for mimicking the human form, though in their own distinct style. Sijan\u2019s interpretation carries on in the old form of the Classics with his realism and expression of energy, but he deviates from the ideal form. According to his website, \u201chis figures are more gritty, more natural\u2013a tribute to real people.\u201d\r\n\r\n<p>His goal is to capture a life force, and that he does. In addition, he wants to \u201ccreate sculpture that could stand alone, on the verge of movement, yet somehow remain deeply silent and \u2018spiritual.\u2019\u201d When viewing his sculptures, now located in Texas A&M\u2019s J. Wayne Stark Gallery, the viewer can become captivated by the realness and beauty of the sculpture. One almost expects a sculpture to take a breath, or walk away to see another exhibit.\r\n\r\n<p>Sijan works from live models in order to \u201ccelebrate the individual.\u201d He produces a negative mold in plaster, and then sculpts the interior with special tools and a magnifying glass. His next step is to cast the figure in a polyester resin. After the figure is sculpted, he applies twenty-five coats of paint and adds varnish. His realism is further enhanced by \u201cvariations\u201d like goosebumps, skin imperfections, birthmarks, and age spots.\r\n\r\n<p>The artist\u2019s figures vary from a middle-aged maid to a ballerina, to an oriental girl, and even a Crucifix. In creating such a diverse group of subjects, Sijan says that his work \u201ccelebrates the individual, and in discovering version after version of the human figure, there is always something of oneself lying just under the surface\u2026the human form is the oldest artistic subject\u2026we just keep interpreting it over and over.\u201d\r\n\r\n<p>The collection of human forms, which is a treat for art lovers and is a deviation from the art typically seen in Bryan/College Station. It is on display at the Stark Gallery until April 19, 2009, and is well worth the trip to campus to see such a dazzling display of artistry. Catherine Hastedt, the director of the gallery, said that Sijan\u2019s work was displayed in the Stark Gallery in 2003, with a wonderful response, especially from students. She also said that the current show is just as successful \u201cwith many people returning so they can bring their friends and relatives to see it too.\u201d The show is one stop on a nation-wide tour of the United States that is spanning two and a half years.", "user": 3, "last_modified": "2009-04-07 14:22:36", "image": "img/story/_art979opening_60_smaller.jpg", "pub_date": "2009-04-07 01:50:02", "artists": [], "venues": [49]}}, {"pk": 11, "model": "Story.story", "fields": {"subject": "other", "published": 1, "featured": 1, "events": [], "headline": "MSC To Close For Renovation", "body": "<p>Change seems to be the theme of the year, trickling all the way from Washington to College Station and Texas A&M. In May, A&M will undergo a huge change when the Memorial Student Center Complex closes for a three-year renovation. Not only will many aspects of campus life be affected, but the closing also provides a major dilemma for various art institutions located in the MSC like the Forsyth Center Galleries, The J. Wayne Stark Galleries, and the MSCC Visual Arts Committee. At present, art remains a minor influence at Texas A&M, and most of that influence is housed in the MSC. With the closing, art establishments are faced with a unique and difficult situation in maintaining the influence of the arts on campus.\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The MSCC Visual Arts Committee is one of the oldest student-run committees in the history of MSC committees. According to the chairman of the committee, Jamie Potter, \u201cVAC has brought professional artwork and educational programs to campus for easy access to students.\u201d She said \u201cVAC has a gallery space in the Stark Galleries\u2026the gallery space houses the exhibitions VAC brings to campus through student service fees\u2026\u201d Every year, VAC picks a diverse lineup of artists from around the nation to be put on display. In addition, VAC puts on ArtFest, a juried art show open for entry to all students at A&M. However, Potter explained that VAC will have to do some adjusting in light of the MSC closing. \u201cAs of right now there is not an on campus assignment for a VAC gallery,\u201d she said. In addition, VAC will have to pare down the number and type of exhibitions it puts on, featuring two student artists next year, and one \u201cblockbuster\u201d artist per semester instead of strictly professional scheduling. She said that, \u201cthrough the renovation, VAC will remain in operation\u2026but the face of VAC might be altered to accommodate the changes in location for the next three years.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The J. Wayne Stark University Center Galleries are also gearing up for change. The Stark Galleries were opened in 1992, and bring exhibitions to campus that \u201crange from traditional fine arts such as painting, sculpture and photography to history, architecture, and archeology,\u201d according to director and curator Catherine Hastedt. \u201cWe try to bring in exhibitions that tie in to the curriculum in some manner so that faculty will make use of the galleries in their classes,\u201d she added. Additionally, the department is also responsible for maintaining an inventory of all the art on campus. The Stark Galleries also host many art related events like lectures, gallery talks, hands-on workshops, and live art demonstrations. When the MSC closes, though, the galleries will be doing some adjustments. According to Hastedt, the efforts will still be made to reach students. \u201cRight now we are investigating using both the Wright Gallery in Langford and the Benz Gallery in the Hort/Forest Sci building for occasional exhibitions,\u201d she said. The Stark Galleries will also be putting on an exhibition in the fall called \u201cCreative Photograph in Archaeology\u201d and hopes to have an outdoor sculpture show.\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cWe hope students will continue to visit our website, sign up for our listserv, and watch the news for our events,\u201d she added.\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, the Stark Galleries hopes to increase visibility when the MSC is reopened in 2012. \u201cWe are discussing large banners and digital signage outside the galleries\u2019 doors and visitors may see some architectural changes,\u201d said Hastedt. However, final plans for the new and improved Stark Galleries are yet to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, the MSCC Forsyth Center Galleries are \u201can educational and cultural institution dedicated to stimulating public awareness and disseminating knowledge of the arts through collecting, exhibiting, preserving, and interpreting works of art in order to enrich educational, cultural and artistic communities\u2026 The Forsyth Center Galleries is home to the Bill and Irma Runyon art collections, which contain a world-class collection of English Cameo glass as well as 19th and 20th Century art glass and American Paintings.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The Forsyth Center Galleries is also home to the Student Docents program and fosters interest in the arts by hosting events like Aggie Visionaries, Forsyth Fridays, Brown Bag Lectures, and others.\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Nan Curtis, the director of the galleries said the she thinks the MSC plays a significant part of bringing the arts to the A&M campus. \u201cThere exists no official art department here at Texas A&M\u2026however, the MSCC is able to offset this by providing programming through OPAS, the VAC, Town Hall Concerts, the Forsyth Center Galleries, and more,\u201d she said.\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Curtis said that the role of the galleries after the closing of the MSC has not yet been defined, but \u201cthe safety of the collection will be ensured.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The Forsyth Center Galleries will be new and improved when the MSC reopens, though. \u201cWe plan to implement a digitization program so that we can present the collection electronically though our website, in-gallery computers, and as a collaboration with ArtStor,\u201d told Curtis. She also added, \u201ca new gallery will ensure an enhanced presentation of the Runyon collection and other programming coordinated by the Forsyth Center Galleries.\u201d", "user": 3, "last_modified": "2009-04-07 14:26:14", "image": "img/story/__art979opening_60_smaller.jpg", "pub_date": "2009-04-06 15:02:21", "artists": [], "venues": [47, 49]}}, {"pk": 12, "model": "Story.story", "fields": {"subject": "other", "published": 1, "featured": 1, "events": [], "headline": "The Story of Art979", "body": "<p>Kristy Petty, owner of art979 in downtown Bryan, had a passion and an idea and did something about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Petty, a 1998 graduate of Texas A&M, had a background in theater in high school, and said she didn\u2019t realize how much she missed art until she \u201cfelt like there was not enough here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Petty was under the impression that she had to travel to Houston to see a good piece of art, but found out otherwise. \u201cWhen I started looking here, I found out it was here, but was not well represented. It doesn\u2019t get enough notice, so I wanted to start a business to create awareness of all the art that this area has to offer.\u201d And start a business she did. Petty put her plan into action and opened art979 on November 7, 2008.\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Art979 started as a \u201cglorified office for the ultimate goal of having a publication and a website,\u201d Petty explained. Her idea grew and bloomed, and Petty has now partnered with Kylie Beard, who owns The Village Caf\u00e9, an all-natural organic restaurant in the same building.\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cThe partnership with Kylie has a good ring with local art and local food. Artists and art are typically more aware of the earth and sustainability, so the art and food go together,\u201d said Petty. Food at the Village Caf\u00e9 is presented by Chef Martin as an art form with the presentation and type of food served.\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, Petty would like \u201cfor downtown Bryan to be seen as an art Mecca for the area and for Texas.\u201d She said she wants her gallery to be a complement to what is already going on the in the downtown scene, and wants to help debunk the myth that College Station is not a fruitful place for cultivating the arts. \u201cI want to encourage more artists to join this art community and make it grow,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the past, the artists here have been suitcase artists. They come for school and do not feel enough of an art hub to foster their creativity, and I want that to change. The university and this town pull in a lot of interesting people, but the lack of a defined art culture causes people to feel like they can\u2019t stay very long.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So far, the venture seems to be a good one. \u201cThere is nothing like working in downtown Bryan and being able to walk around and experience the kind business owners and giving people that are drawn to this environment,\u201d Petty told. In addition to being a hub for artists and art lovers, art979 has been a personal joy for Petty. \u201cI have a personal mantra about my career. I work to live and not live to work. This job truly ties in with my passions and keeps me surrounded by interesting people. I have never enjoyed coming to work so much.\u201d\r\n", "user": 3, "last_modified": "2009-04-07 14:48:02", "image": "img/story/_lazy.afternoon.jpg", "pub_date": "2009-04-07 14:46:04", "artists": [], "venues": [80]}}, {"pk": 13, "model": "Story.story", "fields": {"subject": "other", "published": 1, "featured": 1, "events": [], "headline": "The Theatre Company of BCS", "body": "<p>Just as Shakespeare\u2019s company transitioned from Lord Chamberlain\u2019s Men to The King\u2019s Men, \u2018Magination Station has morphed and expanded over the years to become the very successful Bryan Theatre Company.\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>According to Randy Wilson, the director of The Theatre Company, \u2018Magination Station began 20 years ago as a children\u2019s theatre, where actors entertained children. However, when Wilson came aboard, he transitioned the talented children from the audience to the stage to perform in Shakespeare productions. The technique doubled audience attendance. Soon, Wilson added the production of musicals, and the company was \u201coff and running.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Wilson himself has a great amount of impressive theatre experience. Though he was raised in Bryan/College Station, he lived and worked in New York City as a Broadway performer. In addition, he toured the country performing as Jesus in \u201cJesus Christ Superstar,\u201d and worked in film and television, even working for Saturday Night Live.

Wilson said he has never seen the show, but producing it has been a treat. \u201cIt is always exciting to see a musical come to life for the first time. \u2018Big River is an American musical masterpiece\u2026with a glorious score by Roger Miller and great, lean script by William Hauptmann, both of whom won the Tony Award for their work,\u201d said Wilson.\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>He said that the cast is especially fantastic this time around. \u201cThey are a gift from God,\u201d beamed Wilson. The cast is hard working as well as talented. They spend five weeks getting the show on its feet. These five weeks include rehearsing two hours a night on Monday through Saturday, and working every Saturday on sets, costumes, and lights.\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Big River is based on Mark Twain\u2019s Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, and features bluegrass and country music. It ran on Broadway for over 1,000 performances.\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In the Bryan Theatre Company\u2019s version, Clayton Jones \u201cis a superb Huck Finn and Harold Presley is a magnificent Jim,\u201d said Wilson.
