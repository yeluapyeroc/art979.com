Vincent knew from an early age exactly what he wanted to do with his life. Born to loving, creative, and supportive parents and family, he was encouraged from about age 2 to pursue line, shape, and color, and the creation of art.  J\u2019s mother, an artist in her own right, taught young J. Vincent how to enjoy drawing, painting, and sculpture very early on. Having a fundamental knowledge of the basic art elements (even before reading and writing, some say) helped J. Vincent to build his own reasons and reality toward eventually deciding that his fate and future was held within the creative process.\r\n\r\nJ. Vincent\u2019s works have evolved and grown over the years, and he\u2019s paid his dues through a dedication to the pursuit of his passion and the creative process he so believes in.  Having worked as an apprentice, production artist, and studio artist since his age of reason, he\u2019s sacrificed many other worthwhile endeavors in the name of his journey. J. Vincent holds a BS in Education (Art and Mathematics), and after 13 years of teaching (8 years private and 5 years public) he\u2019s retired by choice to his studio to continue his creative journey and drive toward the creation of unique works of abstract fish art. \r\n\r\nToday, J. Vincent Scarpace\u2019s original works can be found in both private and public collections world-wide, in over 40 different countries and in all 50 U.S. States.
