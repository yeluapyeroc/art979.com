Undoubtedly, Chilifest remains in a class of its own: dedicated to provide a spectacular event, with all proceeds benefiting the community to aid in several worthy causes.\r\n\r\nChilifest Inc.'s first year at the helm in 2000 was indeed, remarkable. Country music sensation Mark Chesnutt headlined the event, and in front of 20,000 patrons, filmed his latest music video on stage. That year, Chilifest Inc. was able to donate over $75,000 to area charities, and further demonstrate their commitment to the community.\r\n\r\nChilifest 2001 was quite a success! The legendary Merle Haggard headlined the event, alongside an all-star lineup that included: Gary P. Nunn, Tommy Alverson, Pat Green, and Jerry Jeff Walker. Amazingly, after leaving a lasting impression among thousands, over $130,000 was donated back to the community.\r\n\r\nDespite heavy rains, Chilifest 2002 was enjoyed by all in attendance.  Chris Ledoux, Pat Green, Cross Canadian Ragweed, Gary P. Nunn, and Tommy Alverson played to a rain-drenched but loyal crowd.  Thanks to all who endured the weather, we were able to donate over $110,000 dollars to our charities.\r\n\r\nChilifest 2003 was a huge success!  Country music legend Willie Nelson headlined the event, and he was backed by Cross Canadian Ragweed, Gary Allan, Corey Morrow, and Roger Creager.  Chilifest 2003 brought a record crowd of over 40,000 attendees, and we were able to give over $200,000 to our charities.\r\n\r\nChilifest 2004 was one of the best ever.  The legendary George Jones headlined the event, he was accompanied by Sammy Kershaw, Pat Green, Cross Canadian Ragweed, and Jason Boland.  Thanks in part to the large attendance numbers, we were able to give over $160,000 to local charities.  Chilifest, Inc. would like to thank everyone who came out to attend, and everyone who makes our great event possible.\r\n\r\nChilifest 2005 was great! Everyone enjoyed the music from Jack Ingram, Cross Canadian Ragweed, Neal McCoy, Pat Green, and Tracy Lawrence. Chilifest Inc. would like to thank everyone again for helping us raise as much money as we can for charity.\r\n\r\nChilifest 2006 was our 15th Anniversary and another great success! Everyone enjoyed the music from Robert Earl Keen, Aaron Watson, Pat Green, Cross Canadian Ragweed, and Randy Rogers. Chilifest Inc. would like to thank everyone again for helping us raise as much money as we can for charity.    Thanks in part to a great turnout, we were able to give over $102,000 to local charities.  Chilifest, Inc. would like to thank everyone who came out to attend, and everyone who makes our great event possible.\r\n\r\nWe are looking forward to entertaining everyone with Chilifest 2009, and helping out the community that makes Chilifest such a success."}}, {"pk": 43, "model": "Event.event", "fields": {"type": 1, "published": 1, "name": "Tran Tran, Great Unwashed Luminaries, El Diablos Bloncos, Red Carpet Jubilee, Dee Use", "url": "http://www.staffordmainstreet.com/", "image": "user/Amanda/img/_Venues019.jpg", "venue": 61, "user": 63, "last_modified": "2009-04-03 10:40:57", "bio": "Electro / Progressive / Live Electronics"}}, {"pk": 44, "model": "Event.event", "fields": {"type": 1, "published": 1, "name": "Myth & Legend, Fire From the Gods, Ring Bearer, Sirens", "url": "http://www.staffordmainstreet.com/", "image": "user/Amanda/img/__Venues019.jpg", "venue": 61, "user": 63, "last_modified": "2009-04-03 10:41:48", "bio": "Hardcore / Electro"}}, {"pk": 45, "model": "Event.event", "fields": {"type": 1, "published": 1, "name": "Jacob Asbil", "url": "http://www.staffordmainstreet.com/", "image": "user/Amanda/img/___Venues019.jpg", "venue": 61, "user": 63, "last_modified": "2009-04-03 10:47:36", "bio": "Jacob Asbil"}}, {"pk": 46, "model": "Event.event", "fields": {"type": 1, "published": 1, "name": "Grupo Fantasma", "url": "http://www.staffordmainstreet.com/", "image": "user/Amanda/img/____Venues019.jpg", "venue": 61, "user": 63, "last_modified": "2009-04-03 10:50:07", "bio": "2009 Grammy Award Nominees\r\nLatin Rock/ Alternative"}}, {"pk": 47, "model": "Event.event", "fields": {"type": 1, "published": 1, "name": "Cruiserweight, Hollywood Black, Radiobox, Heart is a Lonely Hunter", "url": "http://www.staffordmainstreet.com/", "image": "user/Amanda/img/_____Venues019.jpg", "venue": 61, "user": 63, "last_modified": "2009-04-03 10:52:19", "bio": "Indie / Pop Punk / Rock\t"}}, {"pk": 48, "model": "Event.event", "fields": {"type": 1, "published": 1, "name": "Moonlight Movie", "url": "", "image": "user/Amanda/img/Venues013.jpg", "venue": 71, "user": 63, "last_modified": "2009-04-03 10:55:48", "bio": "Grease!"}}, {"pk": 49, "model": "Event.event", "fields": {"type": 1, "published": 1, "name": "Ready Set Go! 5K Fun Run ", "url": "http://www.readysetgorace.net/", "image": "user/Amanda/img/cmlogo.jpg", "venue": 82, "user": 63, "last_modified": "2009-04-03 11:01:42", "bio": "Annual 5k to support science in local schools.

Wayne Stark Galleries at Texas A&M University is proud to introduce Perspective 09\u2019: Floral Art in Motion, scheduled to open April 23 and run through May 31, 2009. This innovative exhibition, organized for its seventeenth consecutive year by the Stark Galleries in collaboration with Texas A&M Horticulture professor James L. Johnson, features artwork created by students of Johnson's floral design course. This year, students are creating floral-inspired kinetic artwork, a difficult medium of art which depends on motion and movement for its effect. \r\n \tIn addition to teaching, Johnson has written numerous works on the art of floral design, and currently serves as the director and curator of the Benz School of Floral Design. His class admits students from a broad array of academic disciplines including engineering, architecture and horticulture; and provides them with a semester's worth of time and instruction to create artwork based on a particular theme. The structure of this unique class offers students a truly incomparable experience- to receive first hand instruction from a celebrated floral design expert, and to present and showcase their artwork in a professional venue. \r\n\tAccording to Johnson, this year\u2019s theme has pushed students to the limit, testing their artistic ability as much as their patience. \u201cThe very thought of creating \u2018moving parts\u2019 with dried flowers and leaves is pretty scary!  Are we crazy?\u201d he mused. \u201cCan this stiff and curled up dry leaf be bent to a new purpose? Color! Color is considerably muted in natural dried material\u2026Movement!  Will the natural air currents be strong enough? Transportation!  How can they get their mobile delivered from the Horticulture Building to the Stark Galleries?  Will it break?  What if it falls apart in the gallery? Obviously, the concepts of balance, proportion and suitability take on new meaning.\u201d    \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe opening of the exhibition will be celebrated with a food and beverage reception on Thursday, April 23 at 6:30 pm at the Stark Galleries, where the students will present and describe their artwork.  Everyone is welcome and encouraged to attend, and no reservations are required.  \r\n \tAfter Perspective 09' leaves the Stark Galleries at the end of May, it will continue showing at the Benz Gallery of Floral Art, located on the Texas A&M campus, in the atrium of the Horticulture/Forest Science Building. For more information on the Benz Gallery, please call (979) 845-1699. \r\n The J. Wayne Stark Galleries are located at the northeast corner of the Memorial Student Center on the Texas A&M University campus. Gallery hours are Tues. - Fri. 9am - 8pm; Sat. & Sun. 12 - 6pm.  Admission is free.
